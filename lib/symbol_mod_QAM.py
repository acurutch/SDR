# Define the symbol_mod module

# # The symbol_mod module takes the following arguments as inputs:

# ## packet_bits                 The bit array to be mapped into symbols (including both the preamble bits and the
#                             payload bits)

# ## scheme                      A string indicating which scheme is adopted (e.g.: "OOK", "QPSK")

# ## preamble_length             Length of the preamble (in bits)

# # The symbol_mod function returns the following argument as output:

# ## baseband_symbols:           The baseband symbols obtained after mapping the bits
