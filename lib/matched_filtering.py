# Define the matched filtering module (Root-raised-cosine filters are used in the Tx and Rx side to form an overall
# raised-cosine response). (split the filters to TX & RX side so the receiver filter could be used to attenuate out-of-band channel noise)
# Source code for the commpy filters invoked here could be found in the following link:
# https://pydoc.net/scikit-commpy/0.3.0/commpy.filters/


# The pulse shaping module takes the following arguments as inputs:

# baseband:                 This is the baseband signal

# M:                        This is the receiver-side oversampling factor, each symbol (bit) being transmitted is represented
#                           by M samples

# fs:                       This is the input sampling rate of the ADC

# alpha:                    This is the roll-off factor (valid value [0,1])

# L:                        This is the length (span) of the pulse-shaping filter (in the unit of symbols)


# The pulse shaping module returns the following argument as output:

# symbols                    The symbols are the results of the matched filtering, decimated.
